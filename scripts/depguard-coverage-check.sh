Each one may currently import anything — the cache, the Matrix SDK, bubbletea — and
`golangci-lint run` will report 0 issues about it.

Add a rule to .golangci.yml under linters.settings.depguard.rules. A leaf package wants an
allow list, which is the shape that cannot fall behind:

    <name>-is-a-leaf:
      files:
        - "**/<path>/**"
      allow:
        - "$gostd"
        - "github.com/EugeneShtoka/yt-tui/<path>"
EOF
	exit 1
fi

echo "depguard-coverage-check: every package under internal/ and cmd/ is named by a rule ✓"
